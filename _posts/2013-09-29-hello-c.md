Run Dev C++ from start menu.  

Press ctrl+n.  
[ctrl+n is standard command in for computer programs, which creates new instance, in our case new file]  

Type this.  

{% highlight cpp %}

#include<iostream>  

using namespace std;  

int main()  
{  
    cout<<"Hello C++";  

    // That's weird. But you are not using this variable at all?
    // Well, as it turns out, your computer is lot faster than you are.
    // On pressing run, the output will print to the screen and screen will
    // disappear.
    // The cin below, holds the screen for you, untill you enter an integer.
    int hold;  
    cin>>hold;  

    return 0;  
}  
{% endhighlight %}


Execute->Compile & Run. 
[Or you can press f11 (better that way)]

Bingo!!
