<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Recently I stumbled across a strange issue. I was performing a headless install of my Raspberry Pi.<br />After enabling ssh connectivity, I was looking into vnc setup that would allow me to use graphical interface.<br /><br />As it turned out, installed version was minimal Raspbian and LXDE was missing. So, I wanted to install LXDE on my pie, but mistakenly I ran the command on my Ubuntu.<br /><br />Since the installation of LXDE was done with sudo command, this ended up changing the owner of the .XAutority file to root. This did not cause any effect immediately, as I assume that .XAuthority file is read only once, before the application startup. But after next reboot, I was not able to log into the Unity desktop, and it used to throw an exception,&nbsp;<i>error reading existing .XAuthority error.</i><br /><br />The next thing that I did was to login via tty and inspect the .XAuthority file. I noticed that the owner of the file was now set to root. I switched the owner back to my user. Surprisingly this did not work immediately and I had to reboot my machine to get GUI working.<br /><br />To summarize, if you face this issue:<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Verify that you are the owner of .XAuthority file.</li><ul><li>For this you will have to log in via tty, which can be done by pressing ctrl+alt+F{2-6}</li><li>This would bring up a text console and bash would work here.</li></ul><li>If the owner of this file is not set to your user and set to root, reclaim the ownership for your user. This can be done with chown command.</li><ul><li><span style="background-color: #eff0f1; color: #111111; font-family: &quot;consolas&quot; , &quot;menlo&quot; , &quot;monaco&quot; , &quot;lucida console&quot; , &quot;liberation mono&quot; , &quot;dejavu sans mono&quot; , &quot;bitstream vera sans mono&quot; , &quot;courier new&quot; , monospace , sans-serif; font-size: 13px; white-space: inherit;">sudo chown user:user /home/user/.Xauthority</span></li></ul><li>Reboot.</li></ol><div>Hope this helps!</div><div><br /></div><br /><pre style="background-color: #eff0f1; border: 0px; color: #111111; font-family: Consolas, Menlo, Monaco, 'Lucida Console', 'Liberation Mono', 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', 'Courier New', monospace, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 1em; max-height: 600px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: auto; word-wrap: normal;"></pre></div>
